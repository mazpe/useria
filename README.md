# Useria
Phalcon PHP Framework - Test Project 

This repo aims to test the functionaly of Phalcon in comparison to my previous knowledge with Laravel. I will use *Useria* to test Phalcon's CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capbilities of Users from a database. 

## Changelog

So far so good... very simmilar to Laravel. CRUD of Users done fairly easy with scaffolding. Looking forward to exploring Phalcon more indepth.

## Next Project
- Create an API to pull data (perhaps real-time? :thinking: ) from CoinGecko
